In this challenge we will invoke our first command! When you type a command and hit enter, the command will be invoked, as so:

```hacker@dojo:~$ whoami
hacker
hacker@dojo:~$```
Here, the user executed the whoami command, which simply prints the username (hacker) to the terminal. When the command terminates, the shell once again displays the prompt, ready for the next command
