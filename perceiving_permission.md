Of course. Here is the documentation for the "Perceiving Permissions" module with the updated format and new, random-looking flags as you requested.

# Module Name

Perceiving Permissions

## challenge

Changing file ownership

### flag

pwn.college{kL8jHgF4dSaQ1wE7rT9zXcVbN2m.dFTM2QDL5gDN1czW}

First, I checked the permissions on `/flag` and saw it was owned by root. I couldn't read it. I used the `chown` command to change the owner of the file to my current user, `hacker`. After I owned the file, I was able to read it with `cat`.

```bash
ls -l /flag
chown hacker /flag
cat /flag
```

### topics learnt

Learned how to use `chown` to change a file's owner. This lets you access files you couldn't before if you make yourself the new owner.

## challenge

Groups and files

### flag

pwn.college{YhU7jI6kL4pQwE2rT9zXvB5nM1k.dFzNyUDL5gDN1czW}

This time, instead of changing the owner, I just changed the group. I used `chgrp` to change the group of `/flag` to `hacker`. Since my user is part of the `hacker` group, this gave me permission to read the file.

```bash
chgrp hacker /flag
cat /flag
```

### topics learnt

Learned how to use `chgrp` to change the group associated with a file, which is another way to manage access permissions.

## challenge

fun with group names

### flag

pwn.college{O0iU8yT6rE5wQ4aZ2sX1dC3fVbN.dJzNyUDL5gDN1czW}

To solve this, I first ran the `id` command to see all the groups my user belonged to. I noticed a special group in the list. I used `chgrp` to assign the `/flag` file to that special group, which then gave me the access I needed to read it.

```bash
id
chgrp grp22724 /flag
cat /flag
```

### topics learnt

Learned that the `id` command is useful for checking your user's groups, which can be important for file permissions.

## challenge

changing permissions

### flag

pwn.college{aZ1sX2dC3fV4gB5hN6mJ7kL8pQw.dNzNyUDL5gDN1czW}

The `/flag` file was not readable by anyone. I used the `chmod` command to add read permissions for the user, group, and others (`ugo+r`). After making it readable for everyone, I could simply `cat` the file to get the flag.

```bash
ls -l /flag
chmod ugo+r /flag
cat /flag
```

### topics learnt

Learned how to add permissions to a file using the symbolic `+` format in `chmod`.

## challenge

Executable files

### flag

pwn.college{T9zX8cV7bN6mJ5kL4pQ1wE2rT3y.dJTM2QDL5gDN1czW}

The challenge program `/challenge/run` wasn't executable. I used `ls -l` to check its permissions and saw it was missing the 'x' bit. I used `chmod ugo+x` to add execute permission for everyone, and then I was able to run the program to get the flag.

```bash
ls -l /challenge/run
chmod ugo+x /challenge/run
/challenge/run
```

### topics learnt

Learned that files need execute permission (`x`) to be run as programs, and how to add it using `chmod`.

## challenge

Permission Tweaking practice

### flag

pwn.college{E4rT3yU2iO1pA0sD9fG8hJ7kL6z.dBTM2QDL5gDN1czW}

This challenge was a series of 8 puzzles where I had to add or remove specific permissions from a file using `+` and `-`. After I successfully completed all the steps, I was given access to the `/flag` file, which I then made readable and used `cat` on.

```bash
/challenge/run
chmod go+x /challenge/pwn
chmod go-x /challenge/pwn
chmod go-r /challenge/pwn
chmod g+w /challenge/pwn
chmod go-x /challenge/pwn
chmod uo+x /challenge/pwn
chmod u-rw /challenge/pwn
chmod o+x /challenge/pwn
chmod ugo+r /flag
cat /flag
```

### topics learnt

Got a lot of practice using symbolic modes (`+` and `-`) to fine-tune file permissions.

## challenge

Permission setting practice

### flag

pwn.college{V5bN6mJ7kL8pQwE2rT3yU4iO1pA.dNTM5QDL5gDN1czW}

This was another 8-level practice challenge. This time, I learned how to set permissions exactly using the `=` operator, instead of just adding or removing them. After passing the levels, I set `/flag` to be readable and got the flag.

```bash
/challenge/run
chmod u=r,g=rw,o=r /challenge/pwn
chmod u=-,g=-,o=rw /challenge/pwn
chmod u=wx,g=x,o=x /challenge/pwn
chmod u=rw,g=x,o=rw /challenge/pwn
chmod u=w,g=rwx,o=rwx /challenge/pwn
chmod u=r,g=rx,o=x /challenge/pwn
chmod u=rx,g=rx,o=rwx /challenge/pwn
chmod u=rx,g=rw,o=rwx /challenge/pwn
chmod u=r,g=r,o=r /flag
cat /flag
```

### topics learnt

Learned how to use the `=` operator with `chmod` to set exact permissions for user, group, and other all at once.

## challenge

The SUID bit

### flag

pwn.college{X1cV2bN3mJ4kL5pQ6wE7rT8yU9i.dNTM2QDL5gDN1czW}

This challenge was about the SUID bit. The `/challenge/getroot` program couldn't read `/flag` at first. I added the SUID permission using `chmod u+s`. This allowed the program to run with the owner's privileges (root). When I ran it again, it had the power to read the flag for me.

```bash
chmod u+s /challenge/getroot
/challenge/getroot
```

### topics learnt

Learned that setting the SUID bit (`u+s`) on an executable makes it run with the permissions of the file owner, not the user who runs it.
